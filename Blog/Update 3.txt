Brainstorming for where this can go/how I can track the user/parameters I can use to generate music:

Use Max/MSP wind machine to create wind noises

have large field that music changes depending on where you walk
- vector synthesis?
  - where you are determines the sound
  - chords playing in the background through the synth being controlled
  - chords change with time

some notes tied to footsteps
  - not often enough as to be annoying
  - enough as to give the idea of walking

manipulate objects to create new sounds
  - spawning certain objects to create music
  - rolling balls around in a half-pipe or ramp to generate periodic signals
  - 

Have a piano on the ground somewhere

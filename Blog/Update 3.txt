Brainstorming for where this can go/how I can track the user/parameters I can use to generate music:

Use Max/MSP wind machine to create wind noises

have large field that music changes depending on where you walk
- vector synthesis?
     - where you are determines the sound
     - chords playing in the background through the synth being controlled
     - chords change with time
some notes tied to footsteps
